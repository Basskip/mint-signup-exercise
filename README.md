# Replicating Intuit's Signup Page

A part of The Odin Project's HTML & CSS course, replicating the basic HTML and CSS of Intuit's Signup Page

## Things I learned
* The basics of styling HTML forms with CSS
* Flexbox is great for vertical centering

## Things to work on
* Positioning of locks in both buttons is a bit wonky
* Logos under the main logo are all individual SVG's, should ideally be a combined sprite
